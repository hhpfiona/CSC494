"""
task_eval.py — CulFiT GlobalCultureQA *task-level* scorer.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
Everything currently in the pipeline (agent_b_engine.precision_score, kp_recall)
scores how well Agent A's *reasoning paths* agree with the ground truth, i.e. it
measures inter-agent behaviour. The professor's repeated point across both
meetings is that this is not the task. GlobalCultureQA is an OPEN-ENDED QA task:
read a cultural question, WRITE a free-text answer, and score that answer against
the golden answer's atomic knowledge units. The only way to know whether the
agentic augmentation helps is to run THIS task with THIS metric and compare.

This module reproduces CulFiT's own metric exactly (paper §3.4.1, eval prompt
§7.9):

  1. Decompose a model answer into atomic knowledge units (one LLM call).
     The golden answer's units are already provided as `verified_points`
     (these ARE grounded_answer_knowledge_points.knowledge_points).
  2. Cultural Precision  S_p = (# answer units that match some golden unit) / m
  3. Cultural Recall     S_r = (# golden units matched by some answer unit) / n
  4. Cultural F1         = 2 * S_p * S_r / (S_p + S_r)
  where "match" is a Yes/No LLM judgement using CulFiT's verbatim eval prompt.

Reference numbers to beat (paper Table 1, Llama-3.1-8B):
  bare Llama-3.1 : P 62.52 / R 68.96 / F1 64.53
  CulFiT(Llama)  : P 74.73 / R 71.21 / F1 72.94

The scorer is answer-source-agnostic: give it (question, answer, verified_points)
and it returns P/R/F1 with a full per-unit trace. So the SAME scorer grades the
CulFiT baseline answer, the agentic-system answer, and (later) a CCKG answer.

PROMPT PROVENANCE
-----------------
This module does NOT invent its own prompts. It loads CulFiT's own strings from
CulFiT/utils/prompt_utils.py via bootstrap (the same file agent_b_engine.py
pulls from), so the answer generation, knowledge-unit extraction, and Yes/No
judging are byte-identical to CulFiT's protocol and the scores are directly
comparable to their reported numbers:
  - ANSWER_GENERATION_SYS_PROMPT / ANSER_GENERATION_USER_PROMT  (baseline answer)
  - ANSWER_EXTRACT_PROMPT_SYS / ANSWER_EXTRACT_PROMPT_USER      (answer -> units)
  - EVAL_CULTURAL_POINTS_PROMPT                                 (Yes/No judge)
Their src/ scripts (answer_extract.py, answer_generation.py, critique_generation.py)
are batch file-in/file-out data-synthesis jobs, not importable evaluators, and
they do `from utils.X import ...` which reawakens the utils/ import collision
bootstrap exists to prevent. So we reuse their PROMPTS (the stable contract) and
supply the thin in-memory evaluator harness their repo doesn't ship. If bootstrap
is unavailable (offline scratch dir), local paraphrase fallbacks keep dev working
but log a warning — a real run must use the bootstrapped originals.

No upstream CulFiT files are modified. The judge reuses the same backend.chat
contract as the rest of the system and the same robust yes/no parser.

    Generate real judge pairs from the eval items and write them for labeling.

    non-matches and borderline cases, not just trivial self-matches.
